<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE
TO
THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>
</div>


<p>This volume is intended to be a contribution, though a very slight
one at best, to a special branch of the study of our own language.
It proposes to trace in a popular manner and for general readers the
changes of meaning which so many of its words have undergone; words
which, as current with us as they were with our forefathers, yet meant
something different on their lips from what they mean on ours. Of my
success in carrying out the scheme which I had set before myself,
it does not become me to speak, except to say that I have fallen a
good deal below my hopes, and infinitely below my desires. But of the
scheme itself I have no doubts. I feel sure that, if only adequately
carried out, few works of the same compass could embrace matter of
more manifold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span> instruction, or in a region of knowledge which it would
be more desirable to occupy. In the present condition of education in
England, above all with the pressure upon young men, which is ever
increasing, to complete their educational course at the earliest
possible date, the number of those enjoying the inestimable advantages,
mental and moral, which more than any other languages the Latin and
the Greek supply, must ever be growing smaller. It becomes therefore a
necessity to seek elsewhere the best substitutes within reach for that
discipline of the faculties which these languages would better than any
other have afforded. And I believe, when these two are set aside, our
own language and literature will furnish the best substitutes; such
as, even though they may not satisfy perfectly, are not therefore to
be rejected. I am persuaded that in the <i>decomposition</i>, word by
word, of small portions of our best poetry and prose, the compensations
which we look for are most capable of being found; even as I have
little doubt that in many of our higher English schools compensations
of the kind are already oftentimes obtained. <i>Lycidas</i> suggests
itself to me, in the amount of <i>resistance</i> which it would offer,
as in verse furnishing more exactly what I seek than any other poem,
perhaps some of Lord Bacon’s <i>Essays</i> in prose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span></p>

<p>In such a decomposition, to be followed by a reconstruction, of some
small portions of a great English Classic, matters almost innumerable,
and pressing on the attention from every side, would claim to be
noticed; but certainly not last nor least the changes in meaning which,
on close examination, would be seen to have passed on many of the words
employed. It is to point out some of these changes; to suggest how many
more there may be, there certainly are, which have not been noticed in
these pages; to show how slight and subtle, while yet most real, how
easily therefore evading detection, unless constant vigilance is used,
these changes often have been; to trace here and there the progressive
steps by which the old meaning has been put off, and the new put on,
the exact road which a word has travelled; this has been my purpose
here; and I have desired by such means to render some small assistance
to those who are disposed to regard this as a serviceable discipline in
the training of their own minds or the minds of others.</p>

<p>The book is, as its name declares, a <i>Select</i> Glossary. There
would have been no difficulty whatever in doubling or trebling the
number of articles admitted into it. But my purpose being rather to
arouse curiosity than fully to gratify it, to lead others themselves
to take note of changes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span> and to account for them, rather than to take
altogether this pleasant labour out of their hands and to do for them
what they could more profitably do for themselves, I have consciously
left much of the work undone, even as, unconsciously no doubt I have
left a great deal more. At the same time it has not been mere caprice
which has induced the particular selection of words which has been
actually made. Various motives, but in almost every case such as I
could give account of to myself, have ruled this selection. Sometimes
the past use of a word has been noted and compared with the present,
as usefully exercising the mind in the tracing of minute differences
and fine distinctions; or, again, as helpful to the understanding
of our earlier authors, and likely to deliver a reader of them from
misapprehensions into which he might else very easily fall; or, once
more, as opening out a curious chapter in the history of manners;
or as involving some interesting piece of history, or some singular
superstition; or, again, as witnessing for the good or for the evil
which have been unconsciously at work in the minds and hearts of those
who insensibly have modified in part or changed altogether the meaning
of some word; or, lastly and more generally, as illustrating well
under one aspect or another those permanent laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span> which are everywhere
affecting and modifying human speech.</p>

<p>And as the words brought forward have been selected with some care,
and according to certain rules which have for the most part suggested
their selection, so also has it been with the passages adduced in proof
of the changes of meaning which they have undergone. A principal value
which such a volume as the present can possess, must consist in the
happiness with which these have been chosen. Not every passage, which
really contains evidence of the assertion made, will for all this serve
to be adduced in proof; and this I presently discovered in the many
which for one cause or another it was necessary to set aside. There are
various excellencies which ought to meet in such passages, but which
will not by any means be found in all.</p>

<p>In the first place they ought to be such passages as will tell their
own story, will prove the point which they are cited to prove, quite
independently of the uncited context, to which it will very often
happen that many readers cannot, and of those who can, that the larger
number will not, refer. They should bear too upon their front that
amount of triumphant proof, which will carry conviction not merely to
the student who by a careful observation of many like passages, and
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span> previous knowledge of what was a word’s prevailing use in the time
of the writer, is prepared to receive this conviction, but to him
also, to whom all this is presented now for the first time, who has no
predisposition to believe, but is disposed rather to be incredulous in
the matter. Then, again, they should, if possible, be passages capable
of being detached from their context without the necessity of drawing a
large amount of this context after them to make them intelligible; like
trees which will endure to be transplanted without carrying with them
a huge and cumbrous bulk of earth, clinging to their roots. Once more,
they should, if possible, be such as have a certain intrinsic worth and
value of their own, independent of their value as illustrative of the
point in language directly to be proved—some weight of thought, or
beauty of expression, merit in short of one kind or other, that so the
reader may be making a second gain by the way. I can by no means claim
this for all, or nearly all, of mine. Indeed, it would have been absurd
to seek it in a book of which the primary aim is quite other than that
of bringing together a collection of striking quotations; any merit of
this kind must continually be subordinated, and, where needful, wholly
sacrificed, to the purposes more immediately in view. Still there will
be many citations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span> found in these pages which, while they fulfil the
primary intention with which they were quoted, are not wanting also in
this secondary worth.</p>

<p>In my citations I have throughout acted on the principle that ‘Enough
is as good as a feast:’ and that this same ‘Enough,’ as the proverb
might well be completed, ‘is better than a surfeit.’ So soon as that
earlier meaning, from which our present is a departure, or which
once subsisted side by side with our present, however it has now
disappeared, has been sufficiently established, I have held my hand,
and not brought further quotations in proof. In most cases indeed it
has seemed desirable to adduce passages from several authors; without
which a suspicion may always remain in the mind, that we are bringing
forward the exceptional peculiarity of a single writer, who even in his
day stood alone. I suspect that in some, though rare, instances I have
adduced exceptional uses of this kind.</p>

<p>One value I may claim for my book, that whatever may be wanting to it,
it is with the very most trifling exceptions an entirely independent
and original collection of passages illustrative of the history of our
language. Of my citations, I believe about a thousand in all, I may
owe some twenty at the most to existing Dictionaries or Glossaries,
to Nares or Johnson or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span> Todd or Richardson. In perhaps some twenty
cases more I have lighted upon and selected a passage by one of them
selected before, and have not thought it desirable, or have not found
it possible, to dismiss this and choose some other in its room. These
excepted, the collection is entirely independent of all those which
have previously been made; and in a multitude of cases notes uses and
meanings of words which have never been noted before.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the present edition the ‘Select Glossary’ has been carefully
revised, and a few of the articles have been rewritten. In the
work of revision special attention has been paid to two points,
the etymologies and the Middle English quotations. The aim
of the editor has been to bring this useful and interesting
little book up to date, by purging it of obsolete or doubtful
etymologies, and giving those which commend themselves to
the best modern authorities on the subject. Nearly all the
quotations from the works of Middle English authors have been
collated with the best modern editions, and care has been taken
to make the references in each case as clear and precise as
possible. It is hoped that the Alphabetical Lists of Authors
quoted, and of Philological Works referred to, may be found
useful to the student.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap"><b>Abandon.</b></span> Now only used in the sense of to give up
absolutely, to forsake, or desert; but in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries often found in the sense of to put to the ban, to proscribe,
to cast out, reject. O. Fr. <i>abandoner</i>, to give up into the
power of another, is due to the phrase <i>mettre à bandon</i>, to
put under anyone’s jurisdiction; O. Fr. <i>bandon</i> (Low Lat.
<i>bandonem</i>) is a derivative of Low Lat. <i>bandum</i> for older
<i>bannum</i>; O. H. G. <i>ban</i>, an order, decree, proclamation. For
O. Fr. <i>bandon</i>, used in the sense of free disposal, unfettered
authority, compare <i>Chanson de Roland</i>, 2703: ‘All Spain will be
to-day <i>en lur bandun</i>,’ i.e. in their power. The Germanic word
<i>bann</i>, an open proclamation, survives in our ‘<i>banns</i> of
marriage.’ The word <i>bandit</i>, <abbr title="Italian">It.</abbr> <i>bandito</i>, means properly a
proclaimed, proscribed man.]</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Achievement.</b></span> Of ‘achievement’ and ‘hatchment’ it need
hardly be said that the latter is a contracted and corrupted manner
of pronouncing the former. This ‘achievement’ or ‘hatchment’ is an
escutcheon or coat of arms erected when a person of distinction has
died; originally so called from its being granted in memory of some
‘achievement’ or distinguished feat. In the Heralds’ College there are
‘achievements’ still, as there were for Milton two centuries ago; but
in our common language we call them ‘hatchments,’ and have let any such
employment of ‘achievement’ go.</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Act.</b></span> The verb ‘to actuate’ seems of comparatively late

Browne, of Norwich. I have also met it in Jeremy Taylor.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> But even
for some time after ‘actuate’ was introduced—as late, we see, as
Pope,—‘act’ did often the work which ‘actuate’ alone does now.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The notion of diversion, entertainment, is comparatively of recent
introduction into the word. ‘To amuse’ was to cause to muse, to
occupy or engage, and in this sense indeed to <i>divert</i>, the
thoughts and attention. The quotation from Phillips shows the word in
transition to its present meaning. [O. Fr. <i>amuser</i> is a compound
of <i>muser</i>, to muse, study, linger about a matter, to sniff as a
hound, from *<i>muse</i>, a muzzle, nose of an animal (whence Mod. Fr.
<i>museau</i>). Compare Florio’s Italian Dictionary: ‘<i>Musare</i>,
to muse, to muzzle, to gape, to hold one’s <i>muzle</i> or snout
in the air.’ The O. Fr. *<i>muse</i> is the same word as the Lat.
<i>morsus</i>, see Mayhew-Skeat, <i>Dict. of Middle English</i>.]</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">It is difficult to say at what date the name of ‘assassin,’ given first
to the emissaries of the ‘Old Man of the Mountain,’ who were sent
forth on his errands of blood, and who bore this name because maddened
with ‘haschisch,’ a drink drawn from hemp, was transferred to other
secret slayers. The word does not occur in Shakespeare (‘assassination’
once), and only once in Milton’s verse. Neither is it found in our
English Bible; although it may be a question whether ‘assassins’
would not be an apter, as it would certainly be a closer, rendering
of σικάριοι, on the one occasion of this word’s appearing (Acts xxi.
38), than the ‘murderers’ which we have actually adopted.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The verb
‘to assassinate,’ as used by Milton, obtained a meaning which still
survives in the French ‘assassiner’ and the Italian ‘assassinare,’ and
signifies, as these often do, treacherously to assault, extremely to
maltreat, without suggesting the actual taking away of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> life, which ‘to
assassinate’ now always implies for us. Doubtless it was the Italian
use of the word which influenced him.</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Authentic.</b></span> A distinction drawn by Bishop Watson between
‘genuine’ and ‘authentic’ has been often quoted: ‘A <i>genuine</i> book
is that which was written by the person whose name it bears as the
author of it. An <i>authentic</i> book is that which relates matters
of fact as they really happened.’ Of ‘authentic’ he has certainly not
seized the true force, neither do the uses of it by good writers bear
him out. The true opposite to αὐθεντικός in Greek is ἀδέσποτος, and
‘authentic’ is properly original, independent, and thus coming with
authority, authoritative.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Thus, an ‘authentic’ document is, in its
first meaning, a document written by the proper hand of him from whom
it professes to proceed. In all the passages which follow it will be
observed that the word might be exchanged for ‘authoritative.’</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">We translate σῶμα ψυχικόν (1 Cor. xv. 44) ‘a <i>natural</i> body;’
some have regretted that it was not rendered ‘an <i>animal</i> body;’
[so R.V. margin, Jude 19.] This is exactly what Wiclif meant when he
translated the ‘corpus animale’ which he found in his Vulgate, ‘a
<i>beastly</i> body.’ The word had then no ethical tinge; nor, when
it first acquired such, had it exactly that which it now possesses;
in it was rather implied the absence of reason, the prerogative
distinguishing man from beast.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The steps by which ‘escheat’ has yielded ‘cheat,’ and ‘escheatour’
‘cheater,’ are interesting to trace. The ‘escheatour’ was an officer in
each county who took notice of fines and forfeitures technically called
‘escheats’ on the royal manors, which had <i>fallen in</i> to the
Crown, and certified these to the Exchequer. But he had commonly such
a reputation for fraud and extortion in the execution of his office,
that by an only too natural transition the ‘escheatour’ passed into the
‘cheater,’ and ‘escheat’ into ‘cheat.’ The quotation from Gurnall is
curious as marking the word in the very act of this transition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And yet the taking off these vessels was not the best and
goodliest <i>cheat</i> of their victory; but this passed all,
that with one light skirmish they became lords of all the sea
along those coasts.—<span class="smcap">Holland</span>, <i>Livy</i>, p. 444.</p>

<p>This man who otherwise beforetime was but poor and needy,
by these windfalls and unexpected <i>cheats</i> became very

<p>By this impudence they may abuse credulous souls into a

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Cheer.</b></span> Cicero, who loves to bring out superiorities,
where he can find them, of the Latin language over the Greek, urges
this as one, that the Greek has no equivalent to the Latin ‘vultus’
(<i>Leg.</i> i. 9, 27); the countenance, that is, ethically regarded,
as the ever-varying index and exponent of the sentiments and emotions
of the soul (‘imago animi vultus est,’ <i>De Orat.</i> iii. 59, 221).
Perhaps it may be charged on the English, that it too is now without
such a word. But ‘cheer,’ in its earlier uses, of which vestiges still
survive, was exactly such.</p>

this more true to its origin; being derived from the Greek κάμινος,
a furnace, as it passed into the Latin ‘caminus,’ whence the Late
Latin <i>caminata</i>, a room with a stove, the French ‘cheminée.’ The
fact that it is the ‘chimney,’ in the modern use of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span> word, which,
creating a draught, alone gives activity or fierceness to the flame,
probably explains the present limitation of the meaning of the word. In

that holds the fire’ (<i>Scoticisms</i>, Edinburgh, 1787).</p>

surviving at the other end in the word ‘infantry,’—that ‘chivalry,’
which of course is but a doublet of ‘cavalry,’ could once be used as
convertible with army. It needed more than one Agincourt to teach that

A ‘chiaus,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> or interpreter, attached to the Turkish Embassy, in 1609
succeeded in defrauding the Turkish and Persian merchants resident
in England of 4,000<i>l.</i> From the vast dimensions of the fraud,
vast, that is, as men counted fraudulent vastness then, and the
notoriety it acquired, a ‘chiaus’ (presently spelt ‘chouse’ to look
more English) became equivalent to a swindler, and somewhat later
to the act of swindling.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> It is curious that a correspondent of
Skinner (<i>Etymologicon</i>, 1671), though quite ignorant of this
story, suggests a connexion between ‘chouse’ and the Turkish ‘chiaus.’
The quotation from Ben Jonson gives us the word in its passage from
the old meaning to the new; while the ‘errant chouse’ in Butler’s
<i>Hudibras</i>, iii. 1, 1249, is rather the cheated than the cheater.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The tendency which there is in the meaning of words to run to the
surface, till they lose and leave behind all their deeper significance,
is well exemplified in ‘civil’ and ‘civility’—words of how deep an
import once, how slight and shallow now. A <i>civil</i> man now is one
observant of slight external courtesies in the intercourse of society;
a <i>civil</i> man once was one who fulfilled all the duties and
obligations flowing from his position as a ‘civis,’ and his relations
to the other members of that ‘civitas’ to which he belonged, and
‘civility’ the condition in which those were recognized and observed.
The gradual departure of all deeper significance from ‘civility’ has
obliged the creation of another word, ‘civilization,’ which only came
up toward the conclusion of the last century. Johnson does not know
it in his Dictionary, except as a technical legal term to express
the turning of a criminal process into a civil one; and, according
to Boswell, altogether disallowed it in the sense which it has now
acquired. A ‘civilian’ in the language of the Puritan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> divines was one
who, despising the righteousness of Christ, did yet follow after a
certain civil righteousness, a ‘justitia civilis’ of his own.</p>

<p>Then were the Roman fashions imitated and the gown; after a

<p class="p1_5 noindent">The verb ‘comfortare,’ not found in classical Latin, but so frequent in
the Vulgate, is first, as is plain from the ‘fortis’ which it embodies,
to make strong, to corroborate, and only in a secondary sense, to
console. We often find it in our early literature employed in that
its proper sense. In the truce between England and Scotland, in the
reign of Richard III., it is provided that neither of the kings shall
maintain, favour, aid, or <i>comfort</i> any rebel or traitor (Hall,
<i>Richard III.</i>).</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Common sense.</b></span> The manner is very curious in which the
logical, metaphysical, and theological speculations, to which the busy
world is indifferent, or from which it is entirely averse, do yet in
their results descend to it, and are adopted by it; while it remains
quite unconscious of the source from which they spring, and counts that
it has created them for itself and out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> of its own resources. Thus,
many would wonder if asked the parentage of this phrase ‘common sense,’
would count it the most natural thing in the world that such a phrase
should have been formed, that it demanded no ingenuity to form it,
that the uses to which it is now put are the same which it has served
from the first. Indeed, neither Reid, Beattie, nor Stewart seems to
have assumed anything else. But in truth this phrase, ‘common sense,’
meant once something very different from that plain wisdom, the
common heritage of men, which now we call by this name; having been
bequeathed to us by a very complex theory of the senses, and of a
<i>sense</i> which was the <i>common</i> bond of them all, and which
passed its verdicts on the reports which they severally made to it.
This theory of κοινὸς νοῦς, familiar to the Greek metaphysicians (see
Cicero, <i>Tusc. Quæst.</i> i. 20), is sufficiently explained by the
interesting quotations from Henry More and Burton. In Hawes’ <i>Pastime
of Pleasure</i> (cap. 24) the relation between the ‘common wit’ and
the ‘five wits’ is at large set forth. For an interesting history of
the phrase, see Sir William Hamilton’s edition of Reid’s <i>Works</i>,
appendix A, especially pp. 757, &amp;c.; and for some classical uses of it
Horace, <i>Sat.</i> i. 3. 65; Juvenal, 8. 73; Seneca, <i>Ep.</i> 5. 3;
105. 4; <i>De Benef.</i> i. 12. 3; Quintilian, i. 2. 20.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The senses receive indifferently, without discretion and
judgement, white and black, sweet and sour, soft and hard;
for their office is only to admit their several objects, and
to carry and refer the judgement thereof to the <i>common
sense</i>.—<span class="smcap">North</span>, <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i>, p. 732.</p>

<p>But for fear to exceed the commission of an historian (who with
the outward senses may only bring in the species,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> and barely
relate facts, not with the <i>common sense</i> pass verdict
or censure on them), I would say they had better have built
in some other place, especially having room enough besides,
and left this floor, where the Temple stood, alone in her
desolations.—<span class="smcap">Fuller</span>, <i>Holy War</i>, b. i. c. 4.</p>

<p>That there is some particular or restrained seat of the
<i>common sense</i> is an opinion that even all philosophers
and physicians are agreed upon. And it is an ordinary
comparison amongst them, that the external senses and the
<i>common sense</i> considered together are like a circle
with five lines drawn from the circumference to the centre.
Wherefore, as it has been obvious for them to find out
particular organs for the external senses, so they have also
attempted to assign some distinct part of the body to be an
organ of the <i>common sense</i>; that is to say, as they
discovered sight to be seated in the eye, hearing in the ear,
smelling in the nose, &amp;c., so they conceived that there is
some part of the body wherein seeing, hearing, and all other
perceptions meet together, as the lines of a circle in the
centre, and that there the soul does also judge and discern of
the difference of the objects of the outward senses.—<span class="smcap">H.
More</span>, <i>Immortality of the Soul</i>, b. iii. c. 13.</p>

<p>Inner senses are three in number, so called because they be
within the brain-pan, as <i>common sense</i>, phantasy, memory.
Their objects are not only things present, but they perceive
the sensible species of things to come, past, absent, such as
were before in the sense. This <i>common sense</i> is the judge
or moderator of the rest, by whom we discern all differences of
objects; for by mine eye I do not know that I see, or by mine
ear that I hear, but by my <i>common sense</i>, who judgeth
of sounds and colours; they are but the organs to bring the
species to be censured; so that all their objects are his, and
all the offices are his. The fore part of the brain is his
organ or seat.—<span class="smcap">Burton</span>, <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>,

Clarendon speaks of the Privy Council as at one time composed of
upstarts, factious, indigent <i>companions</i> (b. iv.). The notion
originally involved in companionship, or accompaniment, would appear to
have been rather that of inferiority than of equality. A companion was
an attendant.</p>

intellectual gifts are too commonly misapplied. Thus there was a
time when the Latin ‘dolus’ required the epithet ‘malus,’ as often
as it signified a treacherous or fraudful device; but it was soon
able to drop this as superfluous, and to stand by itself. Other words
which have gone the same downward course are the following: τέχνη,
‘astutia,’ ‘calliditas,’ ‘List,’ ‘Kunst,’ and our English ‘craft’ and
‘cunning,’—the last, indeed, as early as Lord Bacon, who says, ‘We
take <i>cunning</i> for a sinister or crooked wisdom,’ had acquired
what is now its only acceptation; but not then, nor till long after,
to the exclusion of its more honourable use. How honourable that use
sometimes was, my first quotation will testify.</p>

<p class="p1_5 noindent">A feudal term, beset with many difficulties when we seek to follow
it as it passes to its present use; but very well worth some study
bestowed upon it. Ducange has written on the subject, and Diez, and
Littré (<i>Hist. de la Langue Franç.</i> vol. i. p. 49). [The Old
French <i>dangier</i>, <i>dongier</i>, power, lordship, refusal,
danger, is of Late Latin origin, representing a form <i>dominiarium</i>
(from Latin <i>dominium</i>) which signified properly the strict right
of the suzerain in regard to the fief of the vassal]; thus, ‘fief
de <i>danger</i>,’ a fief held under a lord on strict conditions,
and therefore in peril of being forfeited (juri stricto atque adeo
confiscationi obnoxium; Ducange). There is no difficulty here; but
there is another early use of ‘danger’ and ‘dangerous’ which is not
thus explained, nor yet the connexion between it and the modern meaning
of the words. I refer to that of ‘danger’ in the sense of ‘coyness,’
‘sparingness,’ ‘niggardliness,’ and of ‘dangerous’ in the sense of
haughty, difficult to please.</p>

the defier and the defied to be wholly dissolved, so that nothing of
treaty or even of the natural faith of man to man shall henceforth
hinder extremest hostility between them. But still, when we read of one
potentate sending ‘defiance’ to another, the challenge to conflict did
not lie necessarily in the word, however such a message might provoke

himself from all which hitherto had mutually obliged; and thus it came
often to mean simply to disclaim, or renounce.</p>

distrust pushed so far as to amount to an entire withholding of all
faith from them, being nearly allied to despair; as indeed in <i>The

for elucidating Shakespeare’s text—which was possessed by many of
his commentators down to a late day, that the phrase ‘discourse of
reason,’ which he puts into Hamlet’s mouth, should have perplexed
them so greatly. Gifford, a pitiless animadverter on the real or
imaginary mistakes of others, and who tramples upon Warburton for
attempting to explain this phrase as though Shakespeare could have
ever written it, declares ‘“discourse <i>of</i> reason” is so poor
and perplexed a phrase that I should dismiss it at once for what I
believe to be his genuine language;’ and then proceeds to suggest
the obvious but erroneous correction ‘discourse <i>and</i> reason’ (see his
<i>Massinger</i>, vol. i. p. 148); while yet, if there be a phrase of
continual recurrence among the writers of our Elizabethan age and down
to Milton, it is this. I have little doubt that it occurs fifty times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>

ascribes hopeless ignorance, invincible stupidity, to him on whom it is

the Reformation and Revival of Learning the works of the Schoolmen fell
into extreme disfavour, alike with the Reformers and with the votaries
of the new learning, Duns, a standard-bearer among those, was so often
referred to with scorn and contempt by these, that his name gradually
became that byeword which ever since it has been. See the quotation

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Elevate.</b></span> There are two intentions with which anything
may be lifted from the place which it occupies; either with that
of setting it in a more conspicuous position; or else of removing
it out of the way, or, figuratively, of withdrawing all importance
and significance from it. We employ ‘to elevate’ now in the former
intention; our ancestors for the most part, especially those whose
style was influenced by their Latin studies, in the latter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Withal, he forgat not to <i>elevate</i> as much as he could the
fame of the foresaid unhappy field fought, saying, That if all
had been true, there would have been messengers coming thick
one after another upon their flight to bring fresh tidings
still thereof.—<span class="smcap">Holland</span>, <i>Livy</i>, p. 1199.</p>

<p>Audience he had with great assent and applause; not more for
<i>elevating</i> the fault and trespass of the common people,
than for laying the weight upon those that were the authors
culpable.—Id., <i>ib.</i> p. 1207.</p>

<p>Tully in his oration Pro Flacco, to <i>elevate</i> or lessen
that conceit which many Romans had of the nation of the
Jews, objects little less unto them than our Saviour in
this place doth, to wit that they were in bondage to the
Romans.—<span class="smcap">Jackson</span>, <i>Of the Primeval Estate of

</div>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Embezzle.</b></span> A man can now only ‘embezzle’ another man’s
property; he might once ‘embezzle’ his own. Thus, while we might now
say that the Unjust Steward ‘embezzled’ his lord’s goods (<i>Luke</i>
xvi. 1), we could not say that the Prodigal Son ‘embezzled’ the portion
which he had received from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> his father, and which had thus become his
own (<i>Luke</i> xv. 13); but the one would have been as free to our
early writers as the other. There is a form, ‘to imbecile,’ used by
Jeremy Taylor and others, which has the same meaning as this word.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Hackluit died, leaving a fair estate to an unthrift son,
who <i>embezzled</i> it.—<span class="smcap">Fuller</span>, <i>Worthies of
England: Herefordshire</i>.</p>

<p>The collection of these various readings [is] a testimony even
of the faithfulness of these later ages of the Church, and of
the high reverence they had of these records, in that they
would not so much as <i>embesell</i> the various readings of
them, but keep them still on foot for the prudent to judge
of.—<span class="smcap">H. More</span>, <i>Grand Mystery of Godliness</i>, b.
vii. c. 11.</p>

<p>If we are ambitious of having a property in somewhat, or affect
to call anything our own, ’tis only by nobly giving that we
can accomplish our desire; that will certainly appropriate our
goods to our use and benefit; but from basely keeping or vainly
<i>embezzling</i> them, they become not our possession and
enjoyment, but our theft and our bane.—<span class="smcap">Barrow</span>, <i>The
Duty and Reward of Bounty to the Poor</i>.</p>

<p>Be not <i>prodigal</i> of your time on earth, which is so
little in your power. ’Tis so precious a thing that it is to be
redeemed; ’tis therefore too precious to be <i>embezzled</i>
and trifled away.—<span class="smcap">Howe</span>, <i>The Redeemer’s Dominion
over the Invisible World</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Emulation.</b></span> South in one of his sermons has said
excellently well, ‘We ought by all means to note the difference between
envy and emulation; which latter is a brave and noble thing, and
quite of another nature, as consisting only in a generous imitation
of something excellent; and that such an imitation as scorns to fall
short of its copy, but strives if possible to outdo it. The emulator is
impatient of a superior, not by depressing or maligning another but by
perfecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> himself. So that while that sottish thing envy sometimes
fills the whole soul, as a great fog does the air: this on the contrary
inspires it with a new life and vigour, whets and stirs up all the
powers of it to action.’ But ‘emulation,’ though sometimes used by
our early writers in this nobler sense, to express an honourable and
generous rivalry, was by no means always so; it was often an exact
equivalent to envy.</p>

as a reflexive verb in our version of the New Testament and in the
Prayer Book. Signifying now no more than to try, it signified once to
bend all our energies, not to the attempt at fulfilling, but to the
actual fulfilment of a duty. The force of such passages as Ephes. iv.
3, ‘<i>endeavouring</i> to keep the unity of the Spirit,’ is greatly
weakened by giving to ‘endeavour’ its modern sense. Attaching to it
this, we may too easily persuade ourselves that the Apostle does no
more than bid us to attempt to preserve this unity, and that he quite
recognizes the possibility of our being defeated in this attempt.</p>

pleasures of the table; ‘gourmets’ rather than ‘gourmands.’ We may
trace two earlier stages in its meaning. By Lord Bacon and others the
followers of Epicurus, whom we should call Epicureans, are often called
‘Epicures,’ after the name of the founder of their sect. From them
it was transferred to all who were, like them, deniers of a divine
Providence; and this is the common use of it by our elder divines. But
inasmuch as those who have persuaded themselves that there is nothing
above them, will seek their good, since men must seek it somewhere,
in the things beneath them, in sensual delights, the name has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
transferred, by that true moral instinct which is continually at work
in speech, from the philosophical speculative atheist to the human
swine for whom the world is but a feeding-trough.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Fancy.</b></span> The distinction between ‘fancy’ and
‘imagination,’ for which Wordsworth so earnestly contended,
has obtained full recognition. It was the more easy for it to
find acceptance from the fact that it fell in with a certain
<i>clinamen</i>, a disposition already obscurely working in the minds
of men, to ascribe different domains of meaning to these several words.
But while what has been thus done has been well done, it would be a
mistake to regard this as an old distinction that was now recovered
from the oblivion into which it had fallen. The Greeks ascribed no such
subordination of φαντασία (‘phantasy,’ ‘phansy,’ ‘fancy’) to some other
word, as we now ascribe to ‘fancy’ in its relation to ‘imagination.’
Φαντασία was for Plato and Aristotle (see too Longinus, c. 15), all
that ‘imagination’ is for us, the power which summons up before the
mind’s eye of the poet, and of as many as he can carry along with him,
the forms of things not present, shaping and moulding, dissolving
and reuniting and fusing these at his will; while ‘fancy,’ as we now
understand the word, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> humbler offices assigned to it, as
the aggregative and associated power, more playful but less earnest,
dealing often in prettinesses rather than in beauties, had not obtained
any special word to express it. At the Revival of Learning both words
found themselves in our English vocabulary; but far down into the
seventeenth century there was no sense of any distinction between
them; they were simply duplicates, one from the Greek and one from
the Latin. They are constantly employed by Henry More as absolutely
convertible; and where Milton makes any difference between them, it
is to the advantage of ‘fancy,’ which includes ‘imagination’ as a
greater includes a less. At a later day it was felt to be a waste of
wealth to have two words absolutely identical in meaning for one and
the same mental operation; above all, while another went without any
to designate it at all; and thus the instinct which is ever at work
in a language for the making the most of its resources began to work
for the desynonymizing of ‘imagination’ and ‘fancy.’ This could only
be effected by the coming down of one or the other from its height of
place. The lot naturally fell on ‘fancy,’ the grand φαντάζεσθαι, on
which it rested, being far more obscured to such as were not scholars,
than the Latin ‘imago,’ on which ‘imagination’ reposed.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">There are two points of difference between the past use of ‘forlorn
hope’ and the present. The first, that it was seldom used,—I can
recall no single example,—in that which is now its only application,
namely, of those who, being the first to mount the breach, thus set
their lives upon a desperate hazard; but always of the skirmishers and
others thrown out in front of an army about to engage. Here, indeed,
the central notion of the word may be affirmed to agree with that it
has now. These first come to hand-strokes with the enemy; they bear
the brunt of their onset; with less likelihood therefore that they
will escape than those who come after. This is quite true, and it
comes remarkably out in my first quotation from Holland; just as in
a retreat they are the ‘forlorn hope’ (<i>Swedish Intelligencer</i>,
vol. i. p. 163), who bring up the rear. But in passages innumerable
this of the greater hazard to which the ‘forlorn hope’ are exposed,
has quite disappeared, and the ‘forlorn’ (for ‘hope’ is often omitted)

progress of the word. It is derived from the Low Latin ‘garbellare,’ to
sift or cleanse corn from any dust or rubbish which may have become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
mingled with it. It was then applied to any separation of the good
from the bad, retaining that, rejecting this, and used most commonly
of spices; then generally to picking and choosing, but without any
intention to select the better and to dismiss the worse: and lastly,
as at present, to picking and choosing with the distinct purpose of
selecting that which should convey the worse impression, and dismissing
that which should have conveyed a truer and a better. It is a very

<p class="p1_5 noindent">As metaphysics have yielded us ‘common sense,’ and logic ‘formal’ and
‘formality,’ so we owe to theology ‘good-nature.’ By it our elder
divines understood far more than we understand by it now; even all
which it is possible for a man to have, without having the grace of
God. The contrast between grace and nature was of course unknown to the
Greeks; but, this being kept in mind, we may say that the ‘good-nature’
of our theology two centuries ago was as nearly as possible expressed
by the εὐφυΐα of Aristotle (<i>Eth. Nic.</i> iii. 7; compare the
‘heureusement né’ of the French); the genial preparedness for the
reception of every high teaching. In the paper of <i>The Spectator</i>,
quoted below, which treats exclusively of ‘good-nature,’ the word is
passing, but has by no means passed, into its modern meaning. See
‘Ill-nature.’</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Good-nature</i>, being the relics and remains of that
shipwreck which Adam made, is the proper and immediate
disposition to holiness. When <i>good-nature</i> is heightened
by the grace of God, that which was natural becomes now
spiritual.—Bishop <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, <i>Sermon preached at the
Funeral of Sir George Dalstone</i>.</p>

<p><i>Good-nature!</i> alas, where is it? Since Adam fell, there
was never any such thing in rerum naturâ; if there be any good
thing in any man, it is all from grace. We may talk of this
and that, of <i>good-natured men</i>, and I know not what;
but the very truth is, set grace aside (I mean all grace,
both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span> renewing grace and restraining grace), there is no more
<i>good-nature</i> in any man than there was in Cain and in
Judas. That thing which we use to call <i>good-nature</i> is
indeed but a subordinate means or instrument, whereby God
restraineth some men more than others, from their birth and
special constitution, from sundry outrageous exorbitances,
and so is a branch of this restraining grace whereof we now
speak.—<span class="smcap">Sanderson</span>, <i>Sermons</i>, 1671, vol. i. p.
279.</p>

<p>If any good did appear in the conversation of some men who
followed that religion [the Pagan], it is not to be imputed
to the influence of that, but to some better cause; to the
relics of <i>good-nature</i>, to the glimmerings of natural
light, or (perhaps also) to secret whispers and impressions
of divine grace on some men’s minds vouchsafed in pity to
them.—<span class="smcap">Barrow</span>, <i>Sermon 14 on the Apostles’ Creed</i>.</p>

<p>They [infidels] explode all natural difference of good and
evil; deriding benignity, mercy, pity, gratitude, ingenuity;
that is, all instances of <i>good-nature</i>, as childish
and silly dispositions.—Id., <i>Sermon 6 on the Apostles’
Creed</i>.</p>

<p>Xenophon, in the Life of his imaginary Prince, is always

hero, which he tells us he brought into the world with
him.—<i>Spectator</i>, no. 169.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Gossip.</b></span> It would be interesting to collect instances
in which the humbler classes of society have retained the correct
use of a word, which has been let go by those of higher education.
‘Gossip’ is one, being still used by our peasantry in its first and
etymological sense, namely as a sponsor in baptism—one <i>sib</i> or
akin in <i>God</i>, according to the doctrine of the medieval Church,
that sponsors contracted a spiritual affinity with the child for whom
they stood. ‘Gossips,’ in this primary sense, would often be familiar
with one another—and thus the word was applied to all familiars and
intimates. At a later day it came to signify such idle talk, the
‘commérage’ (which word has exactly the same history), which too often
would find place in the intercourse of such.</p>

we are.—<span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>, <i>The Staple of News, The

<p>Thus fareth the golden mean, through the misconstruction of
the extremes. Well-tempered zeal is lukewarmness; devotion
is hypocrisy; charity, ostentation; constancy, obstinacy;
gravity, pride; humility, abjection of spirit; and so go

and envy are <i>gossips</i>, be sure the child shall be
nicknamed.—<span class="smcap">Whitlock</span>, <i>Zootomia</i>, p. 3.</p>

to fatigue, hunger, thirst, heat, cold, and the like. But it had once
a far more prevailing sense of bold, which now only remains to it in

meaning thereby a bold, assertion; though never now of a ‘hardy,’ if we

we are truer to the proper meaning of ‘harvest’ than the Germans, who
have transferred the word from the former to the latter; for it is
closely related with the Greek καρπός. Occasionally, however, as in the

<p class="p1_5 noindent">The four ‘humours’ in man, according to the old physicians, were blood,
choler, phlegm, and melancholy. So long as these were duly tempered,
all would be well. But so soon as any of them unduly preponderated,
the man became ‘humourous,’ one ‘humour’ or another bearing too great
a sway in him. As such, his conduct would not be according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
received rule of other men, but have something peculiar, whimsical,
self-willed in it. In this the self-asserting character of the
‘humourous’ man lay the point of contact, the middle term, between
the modern use of ‘humour’ and the ancient. It was his ‘humour’ which
would lead a man to take an original view and aspect of things, a
‘humourous’ aspect, first in the old sense, which in some of our
provincial dialects still lives on, and then in that which we now
employ. The classical passage in English literature on ‘humour’ and its
history is the Prologue, or ‘Stage,’ as it is called, to Ben Jonson’s
<i>Every Man out of his Humour</i>; it is, however, too long to cite;
an earlier occurs in Gower’s <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, lib. 7, in init.
See ‘Temper.’ ‘Humourous’ has been sometimes used in quite another
sense, as simply equivalent to moist; so in the passage from Chapman’s
<i>Homer</i>, quoted below.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">A word with a very interesting and instructive history, which,
however, is only fully intelligible by a reference to the Greek. The
ἰδιώτης or ‘idiot’ is first the private man as distinguished from
the man sustaining a public office; then, inasmuch as public life
was considered an absolutely necessary condition of man’s highest
education, the untaught or mentally undeveloped, as distinguished from
the educated; and only after it had run through these courses did
‘idiot’ come to signify what ἰδιώτης never did, the man whose mental
powers are not merely unexercised but deficient, as distinguished from
him in full possession of them. This is the only employment to which
we now put the word; but examples of its earlier and more Greek uses
are frequent in Jeremy Taylor and others. See my <i>Synonyms of the
N.T.</i> § 79.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And here, again, their allegation out of Gregory the First
and Damascene, That images be the laymen’s books, and that
pictures are the Scripture of <i>idiots</i> and simple persons,
is worthy to be considered.—<i>Homilies; Against Perils of
Idolatry</i>.</p>

<p>It is clear, by Bellarmine’s confession, that S. Austin
affirmed that the plain places of Scripture are sufficient to
all laics, and all <i>idiots</i> or private persons.—Bishop
<span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, <i>A Dissuasive from Popery</i>, part ii. b.

persecuted even to death by the high priests, lawyers, scribes,
doctors, and rabbies.—<span class="smcap">Blount</span>, <i>Philostratus</i>, p.
237.</p>

<p>It [Scripture] speaks commonly according to vulgar

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Indolence.</b></span> ‘Indolentia’ was a word first invented by
Cicero, when he was obliged to find some equivalent for the ἀπάθεια
of certain Greek schools. That it was not counted one of his happiest
coinages we may conclude from the seldom use of it by any other
authors but himself, as also from the fact that Seneca, a little later
proposing ‘impatientia’ as the Latin equivalent for ἀπάθεια, implied
that none such had hitherto been found. The word has taken firmer root
in English than it ever did in Latin. At the same time, meaning as it
does now a disposition or temper of languid non-exertion, it has lost
the accuracy of use which it had in the philosophical schools, where it
signified a state of freedom from passion and pain; which signification
it retained among our own writers of the Caroline period, and even
later. To this day, indeed, surgeons call certain painless swellings
‘<i>indolent</i> tumours.’</p>

<p>Now, to begin with fortitude, they say it is the mean

and mildness between senseless <i>indolence</i> and
cruelty.—<span class="smcap">Holland</span>, <i>Plutarch’s Morals</i>, p. 69.</p>

<p>Now though Christ were far from both, yet He came nearer
to an excess of passion than to an <i>indolency</i>, to
a senselessness, to a privation of natural affections.
Inordinateness of affections may sometimes make some men
like some beasts; but <i>indolency</i>, absence, emptiness,

qualities, is good; ‘ingenious’ being from ‘ingenium’ and ‘ingenuous’
from ‘ingenuus.’ But ‘ingenuity,’ being from ‘ingenuous,’ should have
kept the meaning, which it has now quite let go, of innate nobleness
of disposition; while ‘ingeniousness,’ against which there can be no
objection to which ‘ingenuousness’ is not equally exposed, might have
expressed what ‘ingenuity’ does now.</p>

<p class="p1_5 noindent">There are three distinct stages in the meaning of the word ‘lewd;’ of
these it has entirely overlived two, and survives only in the third,
namely in that of wanton or lascivious. Without discussing here its
etymology or its exact relation to ‘lay,’ it is sufficient to observe,
that, as ‘lay,’ it was often used in the sense of ignorant, or rather
unlearned. Next, according to the proud saying of the Pharisees, ‘This
people who knoweth not the law are cursed’ (<i>John</i> vii. 49), and
on the assumption, which would have its truth, that those untaught in
the doctrines, would be unexercised in the practices, of Christianity,
it came to signify vicious, though without designating one vice more
than others. While in its present and third stage, it has, like so many
other words, retired from this general designation of all vices, to
express one of the more frequent, alone.</p>

likelihood that he who has no restraints on his belief will ere long

first to certain heretical sects, and intended to mark the licentious
<i>liberty</i> of their creed, ‘libertine’ soon let go altogether its
relation to what a man believed, and acquired the sense which it now
has, a ‘libertine’ being one who has released himself from all moral
restraints, and especially in his relations with the other sex.</p>

further, and within these narrower limits, the ‘lover’ now is always

English; and soon superinduced on the sense of lying concealed that
of lying in wait with the view of intercepting and seizing a prey.

booty quite thrust out that of lying concealed; as in all three of the

<p class="p1_5 noindent">‘Luxuria’ in classical Latin was very much what our ‘luxury’ is now.
The meaning which in our earlier English was its only one, namely
indulgence in sins of the flesh, it derived from the use of ‘luxuria’
in the medieval ethics, where it never means anything else but this.
The weakening of the influence of the scholastic theology, joined to
a more familiar acquaintance with classical Latinity, has probably
caused its return to the classical meaning. In the definition given by
Phillips (see below), we note the process of transition from its old
meaning to its new, the old still remaining, but the new superinduced
upon it.</p>

<p class="p1_5 noindent">The very early use of ‘maker,’ as equivalent to poet, and ‘to make’
as applied to the exercise of the poet’s art, is evidence that the
words are of genuine home-growth, and not mere imitations of the
Greek ποιητής and ποιεῖν, which Sir Philip Sidney, as will be seen
below, suggests as possible. The words, like the French ‘trouvère’ and
‘troubadour,’ the O.H.G. ‘scof,’ and the O.E. ‘sceop,’ mark men’s sense
that invention, and in a certain sense, creation, is the essential
character of the poet. The quotation from Chaucer will sufficiently
prove how entirely mistaken Sir John Harington was, when he affirmed
(<i>Apology for Poetry</i>, p. 2) that Puttenham in his <i>Art of
English Poesy</i>, 1589, was the first who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> gave ‘make’ and ‘maker’
this meaning. Sir Walter Scott somewhere claims them as Scotticisms;

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Miscreant.</b></span> A settled conviction that to believe wrongly
is the way to live wrongly has caused that in all languages words,
which originally did but indicate the first, have gradually acquired
a meaning of the second. There is no more illustrious example of this
than ‘miscreant,’ which now charges him to whom it is applied not with
religious error, but with extreme moral depravity; while yet, according
to its etymology, it did but mean at the first misbeliever, and as such
would have been as freely applied to the morally most blameless of
these as to the vilest and the worst. In the quotation from Shakespeare
York means to charge the Maid of Orleans, as a dealer in unlawful
charms, with apostasy from the Christian faith, according to the low
and unworthy estimate of her character, above which even Shakespeare
himself has not risen.</p>

<p class="p1_5 noindent">We may notice a curious shifting of parts in ‘miser,’ ‘misery,’
‘miserable.’ There was a time when the ‘miser’ was the wretched man,
he is now the covetous; at the same time ‘misery,’ which is now
wretchedness, and ‘miserable,’ which is now wretched, were severally
covetousness and covetous. They have in fact exactly reversed their
uses. Men still express by some words of this group, although not by
the same, by ‘miser’ (and ‘miserly’), not as once by ‘misery’ and
‘miserable,’ their deep moral conviction that the avaricious man is his
own tormentor, and bears his punishment involved in his sin. A passage,
too long to quote, in Gascoigne’s <i>Fruits of War</i>, st. 72-74, is
very instructive on the different uses of the word ‘miser’ even in his
time, and on the manner in which it was even then hovering between the
two meanings.</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Morose.</b></span> It is very curious that while the classical
‘mōrosus’ expressed one given overmuch to his own manners, habits,
ways (mores), very nearly the Greek αὐθέκαστος, the medieval ‘mŏrosus’
was commonly connected with ‘mora,’ a delay;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and in treatises
of Christian ethics was the technical word to express the sin of
<i>delaying</i> upon impure, wanton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span> or, as in the quotation from
South, malignant thoughts, instead of rejecting them on the instant.
See, for instance, Gerson, <i>Opp.</i>, vol. i. p. 377, for evidence
constantly recurring of its connexion for him with ‘mora.’ So long as
the scholastic theology exerted more or less influence on our own,
‘morose’ was often employed in this sense; which, however, it has since
entirely foregone. I owe the third quotation given below to Todd, who
is so entirely unaware of this history of ‘morose,’ that he explains it
there as ungovernable!</p>

<i>Exposition of the Catechism</i>, 1662, p. 123.</p>

Truer to its etymology once, it expressed the <i>cloking</i> of it, the

to determine what their use was is anything but easy. Gifford
(<i>Massinger</i>, vol. i. p. 71) says confidently, ‘peevish is
foolish;’ but upon induction from an insufficient number of passages.
‘Peevish’ is rather self-willed, obstinate. That in a world like ours
those who refuse to give up their own wills should be continually
crossed, and thus should become fretful, and ‘peevish’ in our modern

<p class="p1_5 noindent">‘Pomp’ is one of the many words which Milton employs with a strict
classical accuracy, so that he is only to be perfectly understood when
we keep in mind that a ‘pomp’ with him is always πομπή, a procession.
He is not, however, singular here, as he often is, in the stricter
use of a word. It is easy to perceive how ‘pomp’ obtained its wider
application. There is no such favourable opportunity for the display of
state and magnificence as a procession; this is almost the inevitable
form which they take; and thus the word first applied to the most
frequent display of these, came afterwards to be transferred to every
display. In respect to ‘pompous’ and ‘pompously’ there is something
else to note. There is in them always now the suggestion of that which
is more in show than in substance, or, at any rate, of a magnificence
which, if real, is yet vaingloriously and ostentatiously displayed.

<p class="p1_5 noindent">To charge one with ‘pretending’ anything is now a much more serious
charge than it was once. Indeed it was not necessarily, and only by
accident, a charge at all. That was ‘pretended’ which one stretched out
before himself and in face of others: but whether it was the thing it
affirmed itself to be, or, as at present, only a deceitful resemblance
of this, the word did not decide. While it was thus with ‘to pretend,’
there was as yet no distinction recognized between ‘pretence’ and
‘pretension;’ they both signified the act of ‘pretending,’ or the
thing ‘pretended;’ but whether truly or falsely it was left to the
context, or to the judgment of the reader, to decide. ‘Pretence’ has
since followed the fortunes of ‘pretend,’ and has fallen with it; while
‘pretension’ has disengaged itself from being a merely useless synonym
of ‘pretence,’ and, retaining its relation to the earlier uses of the
verb, now signifies a claim put forward which may or may not be valid,
the word leaving this for other considerations to determine. Louis
Napoleon assumed the dictatorship under the ‘pretence’ of resisting
anarchy; the House of Orleans had ‘pretensions’ to the throne of
France. But these distinctions are quite modern.</p>

<p class="p1_5 noindent">This verb, often now very loosely used, had once a very definite
meaning of its own. ‘To prevaricate’ is to betray the cause which
one affects to sustain, the prevaricator is the feint pleader, as he
used to be called, and, so far as I know, the words are always so
used by our early writers. We have inherited the word from the Latin
law-courts, which borrowed it from the life. The ‘prævaricator’ being
one who halted on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> two unequal legs, the name was transferred to him
who, affecting to prosecute a charge, was in secret collusion with
the opposite party, and so managed the cause as to ensure his escape.

habitually distinguishes our writers of the seventeenth century as

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Purchase.</b></span> Now always to acquire in exchange for money,
to buy; but much oftener in our old writers simply to acquire, being
properly to hunt, ‘pourchasser;’ and then to take in hunting; then
to acquire; and then, as the commonest way of acquiring is by giving
money in exchange, to buy. The word occurs six times in our Version of
the New Testament, <i>Acts</i> i. 18; viii. 10; xx. 28; <i>Ephes.</i>
i. 14; <i>1 Tim.</i> iii. 13; <i>1 Pet.</i> ii. 9, margin; in none of
these is the notion of buying involved. At <i>Acts</i> i. 18, this is
especially noteworthy. It is there said: ‘This man <i>purchased</i> a
field with the reward of iniquity.’ There will always remain certain
difficulties in reconciling the different records of the death of
Judas; but if St. Peter had here affirmed that Judas had <i>bought</i>
this field of blood, these difficulties would be seriously increased,
for the chief priests were the actual buyers (<i>Matt.</i> xxvii. 7).
He affirms no such thing, neither did our Translators understand him to
do so, but simply that Judas made that ominous potter’s field his own
(ἐκτήσατο). The Revised Version has ‘obtained.’</p>

from the Latin. Besides the meaning which they still retain, they once

<p class="p1_5 noindent">In ‘remorseless’ and in the phrase ‘without remorse,’ we retain a
sense of ‘remorse’ as equivalent with pity, which otherwise has quite
passed away from it. It may thus have acquired this meaning. There is
nothing which is followed in natures not absolutely devilish with so
swift revulsion of mind as acts of cruelty. Nowhere does the conscience
so quickly sting the guilty actor as in and after these; and thus
‘remorse,’ which is the penitence of the natural man, the penitence
not wrought by the spirit of grace, while it means the revulsion of
the mind and conscience against any evil which has been done, came to
mean predominantly revulsion against acts of cruelty, the pity which
followed close on these; and thus pity in general, and not only as in
this way called out.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">When first introduced into the language (this was in the seventeenth
century; ‘vox nova in nostrâ linguâ:’ Junius), ‘to resent’ meant to
have a sense or feeling of that which had been done to us; but whether
a sense of gratitude for the good, or of enmity for the evil, the
word itself did not decide, and was employed in both meanings. It has
fared not otherwise with ‘ressentiment’ in French. Of this Génin,
<i>La Langue de Molière</i>, writes, ‘Ce mot, dont l’usage a déterminé
l’acception en mauvaise part, ne signifiait jadis que <i>sentiment</i>
avec plus de force.’ Must we conclude from the fact that the latter is
now the exclusive employment of it, that our sense of injuries is much
stronger and more lasting than our sense of benefits?</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">In our present English the difference between ‘safe’ and ‘secure’ is
hardly recognized, but once it was otherwise. ‘Secure’ (‘securus,’
from sē- + cura) was <i>subjective</i>; it was a man’s own sense, well
grounded or not, of the absence of danger; ‘safe’ was <i>objective</i>,
the actual fact of such absence of danger. A man, therefore, might
<i>not</i> be ‘safe,’ just because he was ‘secure’ (thus see
<i>Judges</i> xviii. 7, 10, 27, and <i>Paradise Lost</i>, iv. 791). I
may observe that our use of ‘secure’ at <i>Matt.</i> xxviii. 14, is in

were employed in the modern sense. ‘We will <i>secure</i> you’ of our

<p class="p2 noindent">There was an attempt on the part of some scholarly writers at the
beginning of the seventeenth century to keep ‘sedition’ true to its
etymology, and to the meaning which ‘seditio’ bears in the Latin. This
is the explanation of its employment as a rendering of διχοστασίαι,
<i>Gal.</i> v. 21, as quoted below; which in our present English would
be more accurately rendered, secessions, dissensions, or divisions;
in exactly which sense ‘seditious’ is there used by our Translators.
So too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> when Satan, in the quotation given below, addresses Abdiel
‘seditious Angel,’ this is to find the same explanation, as is clear
from the words which immediately follow. He the one faithful, taking
the Lord’s side, had in so doing divided the ranks of those who adhered
to the fallen Archangel, and separated from them, being therein
‘seditious.’ The quotation from Bishop Andrewes not less evidently
shows how distinct in his mind ‘seditions’ were from those overt acts
of petty treason which we now call by this name; however, they might
often lead to such.</p>

Milton, feeling that we wanted another word affirming this predominance

imperfectly expressed this, employed, I know not whether he coined,
‘sensuous,’ a word which, if it had rooted itself in the language
at once, might have proved of excellent service. ‘Sensuality’ has

it has now. Any walking by sense and sight rather than by faith was

the word ‘sheeding,’ the name of a territorial division in the Isle of

be content for long to confuse under a common name. Thus in some
provincial dialects of Germany they have only one name, ‘padde’
(compare our ‘paddock’), for frog and toad. So too ‘snail’ (cochlea)
and ‘slug’ (limax) with us were both to a comparatively recent
period included under the former name. ‘Slug’ indeed, in the sense
of slothful, is an old word in the language; but only at the end
of the seventeenth or beginning of the eighteenth century was it
transferred to that familiar pest of our gardens which we now call
by this name. Indeed up to the present day in many of our provincial
dialects slugs and snails are invariably both included under the
latter name; the snail proper being sometimes distinguished from the
other as the ‘<i>shell</i>-snail’ (see Holland’s <i>Plutarch</i>, p.
212). See an interesting discussion in the Philological Society’s

look <i>up</i>, and herein lies the explanation of an occasional use of
‘suspect’ and ‘suspicion’ which we find in our early writers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pelopidas being sent the second time into Thessaly, to make
accord betwixt the people and Alexander, the tyrant of Pheres,
was by this tyrant (not <i>suspecting</i> the dignity of an
ambassador, nor of his country) made prisoner.—<span class="smcap">North</span>,
<i>Plutarch’s Lives</i>, p. 927.</p>

<p>If God do intimate to the spirit of any wise inferiors that

</div>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Sycophant.</b></span> The early meaning of ‘sycophant,’ when
it was employed as equivalent to informer, delator, calumniator,
‘promoter’ (which see), agreed better with its use in the Greek than
does our present. Employing it now in the sense of false and fawning
flatterer, we might seem at first sight to employ it in a sense not
merely altogether unconnected with, but quite opposite to, its former.
Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> indeed there is a very deep inner connexion between the two uses.
It is not for nothing that Jeremy Taylor treats of these two, namely
‘Of Slander and Flattery,’ in one and the same course of sermons;
seeing that, as the Italian proverb has taught us, ‘He who flatters me
before, spatters me behind.’</p>

<p>The poor man, that hath nought to lose, is not afraid of the
<i>sycophant</i> or promoter.—<span class="smcap">Holland</span>, <i>Plutarch’s

<p>He [St. Paul] in peril of the wilderness, that is of wild
beasts; they [rich men] not only of the wild beast called
the <i>sycophant</i>, but of the tame beast too, called the
flatterer.—<span class="smcap">Andrewes</span>, <i>Sermon preached at the
Spittle</i>.</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Symbol.</b></span> The employment of ‘symbol’ in its proper Greek sense
of contribution thrown into a common stock, as in a pic-nic or the
like, is frequent in Jeremy Taylor, and examples of it may be found in
other scholarly writers of the seventeenth century.</p>

sufferings’ of Christ, which must be filled up by his body

<i>symbol</i>; for ‘in the same measure you are partakers of
the sufferings of Christ, in the same shall ye be also of
the consolation.’—Bishop <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, <i>The Faith and

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Table.</b></span> The Latin ‘tabula’ had for one of its meanings
picture or painting; and this caused that ‘table’ was by our early
writers used often in the same meaning.</p>

more closely with the French, the other with the Italian form of
the word, have divided off from one another, but own a common
origin—‘tingo,’ ‘tinctus.’ The fact that discoloration commonly
accompanies decay explains our present use of ‘taint.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Talent.</b></span> The original meaning, as of ‘talent’ in
Old French, ‘talento’ in Italian, ‘talante’ in Spanish, was will,
inclination, from ‘talentum’ (τάλαντον), balance, scales, and then
inclination of balance; thus in Spenser (<i>Fairy Queen</i>, iii. 4,
61), ‘maltalent’ is grudge or ill-will (compare Old French ‘maltalant’
in the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>, 271). It is probably under the
influence of the Parable of the Talents (<i>Matt.</i> xxv.) that it
has travelled to its present meaning. Clarendon still employs it very
distinctly in its older sense.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whoso then wold wel understonde these peines, and bethinke him
wel that he hath deserved these peines for his sinnes, certes

<p>Though the nation generally was without any ill <i>talent</i>

of the Rebellion</i>, b. i. c. 194.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Tall.</b></span> [This word occurs in earlier English with a great
variety of meanings. A very common meaning is seemly, fine, elegant;
for examples see Oliphant’s <i>New English</i> (index). In old plays
it often meant valiant, brave, great (Halliwell). In the <i>Complaint
of Mars</i> ‘talle’ occurs, apparently in the sense of obedient,
docile (see Skeat, <i>Minor Poems of Chaucer</i>, iv. 38). The word
in the sense of lofty in stature may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span> perhaps be distinct from the
above ‘tall’; at any rate the modern sense of tall seems to be the
primary one in the Welsh and Cornish <i>tal</i>, high. See Skeat’s

The happy ‘temper’ would be the happy mixture, the blending in due
proportions, of the four principal ‘humours’ of the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The exquisiteness of his [the Saviour’s] bodily <i>temper</i>

affronts offered to him.—<span class="smcap">Fuller</span>, <i>A Pisgah Sight of

<p>Concupiscence itself follows the crasis and temperature of the

as to those of Galen, or of some anatomists, to find the
reason of these different <i>tempers</i>.—<span class="smcap">South</span>,
<i>Sermons</i>, 1744, vol. ii. p. 5.</p>
</div>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Temperament.</b></span> The Latin ‘temperamentum’ had sometimes
very nearly the sense of our English ‘compromise’ or the French
‘transaction,’ and signified, as these do, a middle term reached by
mutual concession, by a <i>tempering</i> of the extreme claims upon
either side. This same use of ‘temperament’ appears from time to time
in such of our writers as have allowed their style to be modified by
their Latin studies.</p>

there is some exaggeration in them, that He is urging here something
which is impossible, and which, if possible, would not be desirable,
but a forfeiting of the true dignity of man. Or perhaps, if they are
able to compare the English with the Greek, they blame our Translators
for having given an emphasis to the precept which it did not possess
in the original. But neither is the fact. ‘Thought’ is constantly
<i>anxious</i> care in our earlier English, as the examples which
follow will abundantly prove; and ‘to think,’ though not so frequently,
is to take <i>anxious</i> care. To this day they will say in Yorkshire,
‘it was <i>thought</i> that did for her,’ meaning that it was care that
killed her.</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Tory.</b></span> It is curious how often political parties have
ended by assuming to themselves names first fastened on them by their
adversaries in reproach and scorn. The ‘Gueux’ or ‘Beggars’ of Holland
are perhaps the most notable instance of all; so too ‘tories’ was a
name properly belonging to the Irish bogtrotters, who during our Civil
War robbed and plundered, professing to be in arms for the maintenance
of the royal cause; and from them transferred, about the year 1680, to
those who sought to maintain the extreme prerogatives of the Crown.
There is an Act of the 6th of Anne with this title: ‘For the more
effectual suppressing <i>Tories</i> and Rapparees; and for preventing
persons becoming <i>Tories</i> or resorting to them.’ For the best
account of the ‘tories’ see Prendergast, <i>Cromwellian Settlement of
Ireland</i>, pp. 163-183; and compare Carte’s <i>Life of the Duke of
Ormonde</i>, vol. ii. p. 481.</p>

<p class="p1_5 noindent">‘To take umbrage’ is, I think, the only phrase in which the word
‘umbrage’ is still in use among us, the only one at least in which it
is ethically employed; but ‘umbrage’ in its earlier use coincides in
meaning with the old French ‘ombrage’ (see the quotation from Bacon),
and signifies suspicion, or rather the disposition to suspect; and
‘umbrageous,’ as far as I know, is constantly employed in the sense
of suspicious by our early authors; having now no other but a literal
sense. Other uses of ‘umbrage,’ as those of Fuller and Jeremy Taylor
which follow, must be explained from the classical sympathies of
these writers; out of which the Latin etymology of the word gradually
made itself felt in the meaning which they ascribed to it, namely as
anything slight and <i>shadowy</i>. [For the development of meaning of

out of this kinship. In its primary meaning it moves in a region where
the physical and ethical meet; in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span> secondary in a purely ethical
sphere. How soon it began to occupy this the passages which follow will

ingratitude, the word early obtained use as a special designation of
this vice.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">This, which is now the lending of money upon inordinate interest, was

nothing was then a ‘usurer,’ not he, as now, who makes unworthy profit
by the necessities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span> of the needy or the extravagance of the foolish.
It is true that the word was as dishonourable then as it is now; and
it could not be otherwise, so long as all receiving of interest was
regarded as a violation at once of divine and of natural law. When at
length the common sense of men overcame this strange but deep-rooted
prejudice, the word was too deeply stained with dishonour to be
employed to express the lawful receiving of a measurable interest;
but ‘usury,’ taking up a portion only of its former meaning, was now
restricted to that which still remained under a moral ban, namely the
exacting of an excessive interest for money lent.</p>

(<i>Hist. de la Langue Française</i>, vol. ii. p. 166). There could
be no more signal proof of this than that which the word ‘varlet’
supplies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span> I continue to quote his words, ‘<i>Vaslet</i>, ou, par une
substitution non rare de l’<i>r</i> à l’<i>s</i>, <i>varlet</i>, est
un diminutif de <i>vassal</i>; <i>vassal</i> signifiait un vaillant
guerrier, et <i>varlet</i> un jeune homme qui pouvait aspirer aux
honneurs de la chevalerie.’ From this it fell to the use in which we
find it in the passage quoted below from Shakespeare of squire or
attendant, which is also the continually recurring use in the Old
English translation of Froissart. In this sense it survives as ‘valet;’
but not pausing here, ‘varlet’ is now tinged with contempt, and implies
moral worthlessness in him to whom it is applied.</p>

<p class="p1_5"><span class="smcap"><b>Wainscot.</b></span> I transcribe a correction of the brief
and inaccurate notice of this word in my first edition, which a
correspondent, with the best opportunity of knowledge, has kindly
sent me: ‘“Wainscot” is always in the building trade applied to oak
only, but not to all kinds of oak. The wainscot oak grows abroad,
chiefly, I think, in Holland, and is used for wainscoting, or wood
lining, of walls of houses, because it works very freely under the
tool, and is not liable to “cast” or rend, as English oak will do.
It is consequently used for all purposes where expense is no object.
Formerly all panelling to walls was done in wainscot, and was called
“wainscoting.” It was never painted. In modern times it was imitated
in deal, and was painted to represent real wainscot, or of any
other colour, while the name of “wainscoting” adhered to it, though
the material was no longer wainscot. At present, however, the word
“wainscot” is always used to designate the real wainscot oak.’ It will
be seen from this very interesting explanation that within the narrow
limits of a particular trade, the old meaning of ‘wainscot,’ which has
everywhere else disappeared, still survives. It would be curious to
trace how much in this way of earlier English within limited technical
circles lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span> on, having everywhere else died out. For a further

 <a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">18</a> One would willingly know a little more of this phrase
‘lucid interval,’ which had evidently about the time of the first of
my quotations recently come into the language, but from what quarter,
whether from the writings of physicians or naturalists, or from
what other source, I am unable to say. Of its recent introduction
I find evidence in the following passage:—‘The saints have their
<i>turbida intervalla</i>, their ebbing and flowing, their full and
their wane; but yet all their cloudings do but obscure their graces,
not extinguish them. All the goodness of other men that seem to
live, are but <i>lucida intervalla</i>, they are good but by fits.’
(<span class="smcap">Preston</span>, <i>Description of Spiritual Death and Life</i>,
1636, p. 73.) No one would have used this Latin phrase in a sermon had
‘lucid interval’ been already familiar in English, or had ‘lucidum
intervallum’ not already somewhere existed. The word ‘interval,’ it
may be here remarked, was only coming into use at the beginning of
the seventeenth century. Holland in his <i>Pliny</i> uses, but using
explains it; while Chillingworth still regards it as Latin, and writes
‘intervalla.’

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
